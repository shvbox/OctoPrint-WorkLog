# Development environment
All files in the `octoprint_worklog/static/{css,js}` directory will be build with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), from the source in `static/{css,js}`, and not modified directly. The build process includes:
- Static code analysis with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Transcompiling to ES5 with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- Concatinating all JS files into one file `filamentmanager.bundled.js`
- Concatinating and minifying all CSS file into one file `filamentmanager.min.css`

1. Install development dependencies with `npm install`
